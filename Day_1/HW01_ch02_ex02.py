# 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r^3.
# What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? 523.5987755982989

# 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a
# 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for
# each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
# total wholesale cost: $945.45
# 60*24.95*0.6+3+0.75*59

# 3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace
# (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy
# pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
# time: 7:30:06
# (2*(8*60+15)+3*(7*60+12))/60 = 38.1
# (2*(8*60+15)+3*(7*60+12))%60 = 6
#52+38.1=90.1
#90.1%60=30.1
