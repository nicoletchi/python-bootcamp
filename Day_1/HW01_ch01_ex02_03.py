# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
# Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect.
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?

# Insert Answers
# Average Pace (minutes & seconds per mile): 6 minutes, 52 seconds
# Average Speed in MPH:  8.74 MPH

# Insert calculations below (paste from the interpreter):
divmod(((42*60+41)/(10*0.621371)),60)

1/(6*60+52)*60*60
